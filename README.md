# Speech Emotion Recognition using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting human emotions from speech audio using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes audio features and classifies emotions such as happy, sad, angry, and neutral.

This project was developed using a Kaggle dataset and implemented in Python.
